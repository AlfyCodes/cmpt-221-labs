## Errors
----

 There were no errors that I was aware of, however, I did come across one problem with the 'audio' tag. The song was suppose to auto play on the website, but after my first visit it never autoplayed again. Wish I could figure out what the issue there was.
<!--Things that I want to add to the project-->
## Personal Check List
----

* Want to add a Navigation Bar on the top of the website.
* Want to add real life resume text instead of latin fillers. (for Mr. Nomnoms) *Currently working on my resume with a professor.
